When Diego wants to add more apps, the BBS sends a request to the Auctioneer to spin up additional LRPs. LRPsExtra is the total number of LRP instances that are no longer desired but still have a BBS record. If Diego has more LRPs running than expected, there may be problems with the BBS.\nDeleting an app with many instances can temporarily spike this metric. However, a sustained spike in bbs.LRPsExtra is unusual and should be investigated.   Frequency: 30 s\n1.\tReview the BBS logs for proper operation or errors, looking for detailed error messages.\n2.\tIf the condition persists, pull the BBS logs and contact Pivotal Support.",
