    "additionalInformation": "The number of Tasks that the Auctioneer failed to place on Diego Cells. This metric is cumulative over the lifetime of the Auctioneer job.\nFailing Task auctions indicate a lack of resources within your environment and that you likely need to scale. This indicator also increases when the Task is requesting an isolation segment, volume drivers, or a stack that is unavailable, either not deployed or lacking sufficient resources to accept the work.\nThis metric is emitted on event, and therefore gaps in receipt of this metric can be normal during periods of no tasks being scheduled.\nThis error is most common due to capacity issues. For example, if Diego Cells do not have enough resources, or if Diego Cells are going back and forth between a healthy and unhealthy state.\n1.\tIn order to best determine the root cause, examine the Auctioneer logs. Depending on the specific error or resource constraint, you may also find a failure reason in the CC API.\n2.\tInvestigate the health of Diego Cells.\n3.\tConsider scaling additional Diego Cells using Ops Manager.\n4.\tIf scaling Diego Cells does not solve the problem, pull Diego Brain logs and BBS logs for troubleshooting and contact Pivotal Support for additional troubleshooting. Inform Pivotal Support that Task auctions are failing.",
